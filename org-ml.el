;;; Commentary:

;; This is a functional API for org-mode primarily using the `org-element'
;; library. `org-element.el' provides the means for converting an org buffer to
;; a parse-tree data structure. This library contains functions to modify this
;; parse-tree in a more-or-less 'purely' functional manner (with the exception
;; of parsing from the buffer and writing back to the buffer). For the purpose
;; of this package, the resulting parse tree is composed of 'nodes'.

;; This library exposes the following types of functions:
;; - builder: build new nodes to be inserted into a parse tree
;; - property functions: return either property values (get) or nodes with
;;   modified properties (set and map)
;; - children functions: return either children of nodes (get) or return a node
;;   with modified children (set and map)
;; - node predicates: return t if node meets a condition
;; - pattern matching: return nodes based on a pattern that matches the parse
;;   tree (and perform operations on those nodes depending on the function)
;; - parsers: parse a buffer (optionally at current point) and return a parse
;;   tree
;; - writers: insert/update the contents of a buffer given a parse tree

;; For examples please see full documentation at:
;; https://github.com/ndwarshuis/org-ml

;;; CUSTOM

(defcustom org-ml-memoize-match-patterns nil
  "Memoize patterns in `org-ml-match' and friends.

These functions all take a PATTERN parameter that is used to
generate a lambda function, which is then used to computationally
search for the desired matches. Generating these lambda forms has
some overhead (and will increase with increasing pattern
complexity). Therefore, this value can be used to memoize (cache)
each unique lambda form for each pattern. When enabled, calls to
any of the match function using a unique pattern will generate
the corresponding lambda form only once, and then subsequent
calls will retrieve the form from the cache. This can increase
performance if relatively few patterns are used relative to the
calls made to pattern-consuming functions.

The following values are understood:
- nil: don't memoize anything
- 'compiled': memoize byte-compiled lambda forms
- any other non-nil: memoize non-compiled lambda forms"

;;; NODE PROPERTY TRANSLATION AND CHECKING FRAMEWORK

;; This code provides the internal framework for the following
;; operations where NODE is any node, PROP is a property of NODE,
;; and VALUE is the value of PROP:

;; Get: f(PROP NODE) -> VALUE
;; Set: f(PROP VALUE NODE) -> NODE'
;; Map: f(PROP FUN NODE) -> NODE' where FUN is a function that
;;      modifies the value of PROP in NODE and is like:
;;      f(VALUE) -> VALUE'

;; `org-element.el' doesn't always store values as their native types (like some
;; strings look like plists converted to strings). Here, we make a distinction
;; between VALUE and its internal representation IVALUE (which is actually the
;; value stored in the node list and understood by `org-element.el'), where
;; VALUE may not always be `equal' to IVALUE. When performing any of the
;; operations above, this framework will transparently translate between VALUE
;; and IVALUE (using so called encoders and decodes). Furthermore, the VALUE for
;; any PROP must conform to a 'type' which is enforced by this framework.

;; The center of this framework is the constant
;; `org-ml--property-alist' which holds the relationship of all node
;; types and their properties, type checkers, and encoders/decoders.
;; This alist has the following structure:

;; - car of each member is the type of NODE
;; - cdr of each member is the property alist for the node type
;;   - the car of the property alist is the keyword for PROP
;;   - the cdr of the property alist is an attribute plist, and the
;;     keys of this plist include:
;;     - :pred - a predicate function that returns t if VALUE is the correct
;;       type for PROP
;;     - :type-desc - a string describing the data type for PROP
;;     - :encode - a unary function that converts VALUE to IVALUE; if this not
;;       given then VALUE and IVALUE are `equal'
;;     - :decode - a function that inverts the function at :encode
;;     - :cis - a unary function that takes NODE and returns a modified NODE;
;;       the point of this it so 'update' other properties when PROP is changed
;;     - :const - a value that PROP should always have
;;     - :shift - a binary function that shifts PROP; the first argument takes
;;       an integer describing the magnitude and direction of the shift and the
;;       second argument is VALUE for PROP; return a new VALUE; this only makes
;;       sense the type of PROP is an integer
;;     - :require - a boolean telling if PROP is required to be specified when
;;       creating a NODE of this type
;;     - :string-list - a boolean telling if the type of PROP is a list of
;;       strings
;;     - :plist - a boolean telling if the type of PROP is a plist
;;     - :toggle - a boolean telling if the type of PROP is a boolean

;; In terms of property attributes, the three property operations can be
;; described by the following pseudo code:

;; get: GET(PROP VALUE) -> NODE
;; 1) DECODE(IGET(PROP, NODE)) -> VALUE where IGET retrieves the IVALUE of PROP
;;    from NODE

;; set: SET(PROP VALUE NODE) -> NODE
;; 1) if PROP(VALUE) -> t, proceed to 2), else throw error
;; 2) ISET(PROP, ENCODE(VALUE), NODE)) -> NODE' where ISET sets the PROP of NODE
;;    to IVALUE
;; 3) If CIS is non-nil, run CIS(NODE') -> NODE'', else return NODE'

;; map: MAP(PROP FUN NODE) -> NODE'
;; 1) GET(PROP NODE) -> VALUE
;; 2) FUN(VALUE) -> VALUE'
;; 3) if PRED(VALUE') -> t proceed to 4), else throw error
;; 4) SET(PROP VALUE' NODE) -> NODE'

Short synopsis:

Use this function to declutter a node if you are trying to print
its literal list representation or you are running into infinite
loops caused by self-referential lists (there are probably other
valid reasons but these are the main ones).

Gory details:

The :parent property refers to the node one level higher in the
tree that contains NODE as a child. It will be present in a node
that is generated from a parse operation with
`org-ml-parse-this-buffer' or related. This property offers a
nice shortcut to traverse up the node tree from a child. Besides
this, it is not necessary as the tree structure itself already
encodes all parent-child relationships. Further, it is not used
by org-element internally to convert nodes into strings (such as
with `org-ml-to-string') and thus can be thought of as a
'read-only' property. This is why :parent will be set to nil when
building a new node with the 'org-ml-build-' family of functions
and why `org-ml-set-property' forbids setting this property.

In many cases, one can safely ignore :parent unless, of course,
one actually needs to read it with `org-ml-get-parents' or
`org-ml-get-property'. However, it heavily clutters the list
representation of nodes, and therefore it is nice to remove this
property whenever literal node lists are printed/visualized (eg
for debugging). Note that for deep trees, each parent will itself
have a :parent property pointing to its own parent, with this
pattern repeating until the top of the tree.

Furthermore, each parent will itself contain its own child node,
which implies a circular/self-referential list. For the most
part, this won't matter. However, some functions don't like
dealing with circular lists and will complain about infinite
recursion. If this is happening, the :parent property is likely
to blame, and setting it to nil has a high probability of fixing
the issue."

;;; headline (logbook/contents)

;; Everything after the planning and property drawer of the headline can be
;; either part of the "logbook" or the "contents". The "logbook" contains two
;; types of nodes, here called "log items" (or sometimes simply "items" if the
;; context is obvious) and "clocks." The former include any plain-list/item node
;; as given by `org-log-note-headings' (except for 'clock-out' which applies
;; only to clocks), and clocks includes clock nodes and optionally
;; plain-list/item nodes that represent the clock-out notes. Anything that comes
;; after the logbook is deemed "contents." Together, the "logbook" and
;; "contents" are hereafter referred collectively as the "supercontents."

;; There are many ways to configure the logbook, and these are controlled by
;; `org-log-into-drawer', `org-clock-into-drawer', and `org-log-note-clock-out'.
;; These roughly control when the log items and/or clocks are in a named drawer
;; or "loose" by themselves.
;; 
;; Aside from these variables, the logbook will be defined as follows:
;; - a continuous string of multi-line text after the headline metadata (in
;;   other words, the logbook cannot contain consecutive newlines)
;; - any items that are parsed as log items must conform to
;;   `org-log-note-headines', which (for now) means they must end with a
;;   timestamp on the first line (in the future, this will be extended since it
;;   is possible to modify `org-log-note-headings', even if it is not the best
;;   idea). Note this also implies that any log item must have a timestamp
;;   regardless of `org-log-note-headings', which makes sense for a log note to
;;   have...
;; - any clock not are defined as any item that is not a log item but after a
;;   clock
;;
;; The first node that breaks any of the above conditions will be the dividing
;; line between the logbook and contents. Note that the one loophole this
;; creates is that it is theoretically possible (but unlikely) that an item
;; immediately after a clock could be interpreted as a clock note even if it was
;; not intended as one.

;; Since there are many possible configurations for the logbook and consequently
;; many details involved in determining what is "logbook" and what is
;; "contents," there are several specialized data structures used for this
;; process. The logbook itself is represented by an alist consisting of the
;; items, clocks, and unknown nodes from the logbook. This alist is part of a
;; larger list called the "supercontents" which consists of two keys for the
;; logbook and contents. The config for the logbook will be representing on the
;; user side by a plist which corresponds to the possible configuration
;; variables noted above; internally it will be 'encoded' to a more
;; readily-parsable alist.

;; Any operation involving the logbook or contents will either require
;; separating the supercontents of the headline into the supercontents object,
;; merging (the reverse), or both. All cases will require the user-specified
;; config to determine how to perform the separation/merge.
;;
;; Steps for separating a headlines section nodes to a supercontents list are:
;; 1. determine the logbook configuration
;; 2. initialize a list of functions called the "state" which will be used to
;;    identify and collect logbook nodes
;; 3. use the state to "walk" down the nodes of the headline's section, sorting
;;    them as items, clocks, or unknown; as the state iterates, the functions
;;    in the state list will be modified to reflect valid logbook nodes that
;;    can be subsequently parsed (hence the name)
;; 4. Stop "walking" when the state node either runs out of functions or a node
;;    is encountered that satisfies none of the state functions; all the
;;    remaining nodes are deemed "contents"
;; 5. return a supercontents list using the sorted items/clocks/unknown nodes
;;    from the walk and the contents
;;
;; Steps for merging a supercontents list to nodes are:
;; 1. determine the logbook configuration
;; 2. sort the items and clocks by their timestamp (most recent at the top)
;; 3. merge the items and clocks if required by the config
;; 4. encapsulate items and clocks in drawers if required
;; 5. append items and clocks (or drawers if applicable)
;; 6. append the logbook nodes from above with the contents from the contents

called a state is because it will be used in an iterator as the
logbook is separated from the contents, and a 'stateful' iterator
is needed because most logbook configurations have sequential
dependencies for valid nodes."

- :log-into-drawer - corresponds to the value of
  symbol `org-log-into-drawer' and carriers the same meaning
- :clock-into-drawer - corresponds to the value of
  symbol `org-clock-into-drawer' and carriers the same meaning
- :clock-out-notes - corresponds to the value of
  `org-log-note-clock-out'

Any values not given will default to nil. Note that there is no
way to infer what the logbook configuration should be, and thus
this controls how the logbook will be parsed; this means it also
determines which nodes will be returned in the :items/:clocks
slots and which will be deemed :unknown (see above) so be sure
this plist is set according to your desired target configuration."

;;; PATTERN MATCHING

;; This is a framework for applying "pattern matching" on node trees. All these
;; functions search through the node tree and return (and sometimes operate on)
;; a list of matches much like the UNIX find function for searching filesystems.

;; Patterns are composed of the following parts:
;; conditions - match a node based on its type, properties, and index
;; wildcards - keywords that match one of more nodes regardless of type,
;;   properties, and index
;; slicers - keywords with arguments that limit the returned match list to a
;;   subset all matches (such as first match or 2nd - 5th matches)
;;
;; Of the above, only conditions are required in the pattern

;; When a pattern is fed into any of the match functions, it will first be
;; 'compiled' into a lambda function that will walk through the node tree and
;; accumulate/return the results the pattern requests. All possible functions
;; operate on the same data structure which is a list of children in the tree at
;; each level with the indices cons'ed to them like ((L . R) . CHILD) where L is
;; the left index and R is the right index (starting from -1 and counting down
;; to the left given a list of children in a node). The right index is necessary
;; for negative index matching.

;; This data structure ensures that any child has the information necessary for
;; a condition form to determine if a match is successful (if this data
;; structure wasn't used, index matching would fail as it would require
;; knowledge of the entire list when the match is made)

;; For slicers, two tricks are used to ensure that work is minimized. The first
;; is that searches are limited to the maximum number of matches needed. If only
;; the first match is needed, the search will stop after one match. If the 2nd
;; to 5th matches are needed, the search will stop after 5 matches and return
;; this with the first match dropped. The second trick is that the search is
;; reversed if the slicer requests negatively indexed results. If the last match
;; is needed, reverse the tree and return the first result. These tricks are
;; possible/easier with the indexed-children data structure described above as
;; it ensures that indexing information is preserved even when the children are
;; reversed, and ensures that matching can be made on one child node at a time,
;; which guarantees the limit will never be overshot.

(defun org-ml-match (pattern node)
  "Return a list of child nodes matching PATTERN in NODE.

PATTERN is a list like ([SLICER [X] [Y]] [SUB1 ...]).

SLICER is an optional prefix to the pattern describing how many
and which matches to return. If not given, all matches are
returned. Possible values are:

- `:first' - return the first match
- `:last' - return the last match
- `:nth' X - return the nth match where X is an integer denoting
  the index to return (starting at 0). X may be a negative number
  to start counting at the end of the match list, in which case
  -1 is the last index. Using 0 and -1 for X is equivalent to
  using `:first' and `:last' respectively
- `:sub' X Y - return a sublist between indices X and Y. X may
  not be greater than Y, and both must either be non-negative
  integers or negative integers. In the case of negative
  integers, the indices refer to the same counterparts as
  described in `:nth'. If X and Y are equal, this slicer has the
  same behavior as `:nth'.

SUBX denotes subpatterns that that match nodes in the parse tree.
Subpatterns may either be wildcards or conditions.

Conditions match exactly one level of the node tree being
searched based on the node's type (the symbol returned by
`org-ml-get-type'), properties (the value returned by
`org-ml-get-property' for a valid property keyword), and
index (the position of the node in the list returned by
`org-ml-get-children'). For index, both left indices (where zero
refers to the left end of the list) and right indices (where -1
refers to the right end of the list) are understood. Conditions
may either be atomic or compound, where compound conditions are
themselves composed of atomic or compound conditions.

The types of atomic conditions are:

- TYPE - match when the node's type is `eq' to TYPE (a symbol)
- INDEX - match when the node's index is `=' to INDEX (an
  integer)
- (OP INDEX) - match when (OP NODE-INDEX INDEX) returns t. OP is
  one of `<', `>', `<=', or `>=' and NODE-INDEX is the index of
  the node being evaluated
- (PROP VAL) - match nodes whose property PROP (a keyword) is
  `equal' to VAL; VAL is obtained by evaluating
  `org-ml-get-property' with PROP and the current node; if PROP
  is invalid, an error will be thrown
- (:pred PRED) - match when PRED evaluates to t; PRED is a symbol
  for a unary function that takes the current node as its
  argument

Compound conditions start with an operator followed by their
component conditions. The types of compound conditions are:

- (:and C1 C2 [C3 ...]) - match when all `C' are true
- (:or C1 C2 [C3 ...]) - match when at least one `C' is true
- (:not C) - match when `C' is not true

In addition, SUBX may be a wildcard keyword or symbol. These are
analogous to the special characters found in POSIX extended
regular expression syntax. Specifically, `[' and `]' correspond
to `{' and `}' respectively and `:any' corresponds to the `.'
operator. All other characters have the same meaning between this
function and POSIX extended regular expressions.:

- `:any' - always match exactly one node
- SUB `?' - match SUB zero or once
- SUB `*' - match SUB zero or more times
- SUB `+' - match SUB one or more times
- SUB [N] - match SUB N times
- SUB [M N] - match SUB M to N times (inclusive); if M or N is
  nil, this will match 'at most N times' or 'at least M times'
  respectively
- (ALT-A1 [ALT-A2 ...] | ALT-B1 [ALT-B2 ...] [| ...]) - match
  any of the ALT expressions separated by `|' where ALT is a list
  of subpatterns as described above or nil to match nothing;
  these expressions may be nested

If PATTERN is nil, return NODE. Likewise, if any wildcard
patterns match the nil pattern, also return NODE along with
anything else the wildcard matches. Examples of this would
be (SUB *), (SUB ?), and ((nil | SUB)).

For increased performance, this function (and all others that
consume a PATTERN parameter) can be memoized using
`org-ml-memoize-match-patterns'. If nil, PATTERN is processed
into a lambda form for every function call. If t, the resulting
lambda forms are cached for each unique PATTERN, running
generation step only once if multiple instances of the same
PATTERN are used. Note that `org-ml-memoize-match-patterns' is
shared between all functions that consume a PATTERN parameter."

This is the linear-space version of the Myers diff algorithm with

allocating memory for each V-array according to the minimum
string length and using them as circular buffers. After these
edits, the time complexity should be O(min(A, B)*D) and the space
complexity should be O(min(A, B).

Return value will be a list of either '(ins I M N)' or '(del I

insert at I in STR-A, and for 'del' commands I and J are the
indices between which will be deleted in STR-A. Note that
consecutive edits will be consolidated so the length of the

an average time complexity of O(M+N+D^2) where M and N are the
lengths of the old and new strings respectively and D is the
number of inserts or deletes required to change one into the
other. At the cost of performance, only the parts of the buffer
that need to be modified will actually be changed, which is less
likely to disturb overlays and move the cursor (and is also more
like how org-mode's build-in imperative functions behave).

If one does not need this level of precision, use the function
`org-ml~update' and supply nil for the DIFF-MODE argument. This
will simply replace the old node's string representation with the
modified node's string in its entirety. This will likely be
