# Changelog

## 6.0.1

- add tests for emacs 30.1

## 6.0.0

This is a major update for org 9.7, which has been heavily optimized with a new
syntax tree API. This new version of org-ml takes advantage of this new API
(which is much faster) but also breaks several things.

summary of breaking changes

- `org-ml-planning-*` functions have been removed (they are no longer necessary)
- the supercontents data structure (for
  `org-ml-headline-get/set/map-supercontents) has been updated and rewritten.
  See docstring for `org-ml-headline-get-supercontents` for details. TLDR is
  that it now handles planning and node properties. This was done partly to
  better handle whitespace (which was not done correctly previously) and also to
  take advantage of performance improvements in the headline node type (see
  below for `org-ml-update-supercontents`)
- all previous depreciated functions have been removed
  - and `org-ml-timestamp-get/set-range` have been renamed to
    `org-ml-timestamp-get/set-length`
- `org-ml-parse-habits` has been removed, this is now elegantly handled by
  org-element itself. See `org-ml-timestamp-get/set/map-deadline` instead.
- `org-ml-headline-get/set/map-node-properties` now use a list of string pairs
  like `(KEY VAL)` instead of raw node-property nodes.
- `org-ml-timestamp-set-length` now takes a unit argument
- `org-ml-clone-node` has been removed
- `org-ml-unixtime-to-time-long/short` have been combined into
  `org-ml-unixtime-to-timelist` which takes a flag to determine if the hours and
  minutes should be included

summary of added features

- added higher-level timestamp-diary functions for start and end time
  manipulation (new in org 9.7)
- `org-ml-timestamp-get/set/map-deadline` which manipulates what is commonly
  called "habits" (new in org 9.7)
- `org-ml-update-supercontents` and `org-ml-update-supersection` which are two
  heavily-optimized functions which take advantage of the new lazy evalulation
  in org 9.7; use these to update headline contents without touching the
  headline itself
- memoization for builder functions
- ability to switch between pure and impure evaluation (the latter is faster but
  less safe); see `org-ml-use-impure`
